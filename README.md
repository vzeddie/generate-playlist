One from the archives

I had a lot of local movies and TV shows and I wanted VLC to play them at random. However, I wanted VLC to play specific TV shows/movies and not all of them. If one show had 100 episodes and another had 13 (R.I.P. Firefly), I wanted them to have an equal chance of being played. This `.ps1` (powershell) script simply goes into the `ShowList.txt` file and pulls a number of episodes from each directory in the list. Default is 10. The resulting file is a VLC playlist file. Just play the playlist
on shuffle!
